# GitHub Pages
My GitHub Pages site.
You should expect index files and other necessary files here. You can download the source code, but if you're going to use it publicly, you might want to look at the MIT license, which states that you can do WHATEVER with the source code, as long as you include the license with all copies or substantial portions of the code. Thanks!

## Maintenance
If the site is going under heavy maintenance or repetitive changes that will disrupt deployment, you will see a message that says : "Site is going under maintenance", by using another Git branch as a publishing source. Why not just use the branch for the old, unchanged version of the site, you ask? That is a good choice, but I'll have to update both, and merging both may result in unwanted changes that I'd rather not do. So that's why.
Anyway, thanks!
