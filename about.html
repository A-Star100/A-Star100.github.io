    <h1>About A-Star100.github.io</h1>
    <p>
        This was initially my website. It had my projects, and games and stuff. Basically a portfolio.

        I bought a domain for it and moved it to another platform recently. It is currently located at <a href="https://anirudhsevugan.me/" target="_blank">anirudhsevugan.me</a>
