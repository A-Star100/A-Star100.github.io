<h1>Anirudh's GitHub pages site</h1>
<p>Here is a hub for some of my stuff on GitHub. You can view Sonic Channel's app's source code <a href= "https://github.com/A-Star100/SonicChannel-SRC"here</a></p>
<p>More about Sonic Channel anyway. It is basically a source for Sonic news that is no longer being updated. This website and its app were memorable experiences, and changed me as a person. Anyway, there is also some more stuff here. Not public repos, (Other than Sonic Channel and my GitHub config stuff). You can view the Sonic Channel website <a href = "tinyurl.com/sonicnws"here</a></a>if you are interested. You can also see my many apps <a href = "tinyurl.com/sonicmisc"here</a></a>. You can also see a better website of mine (made in a website builder) <a href = "bit.ly/anihub"here</a></a>. Thanks for viewing this GitHub pages website :) </p>
<p>Also, you can see my Scratch account <a href = "scratch.mit.edu/users/SONICWORLD100"here :)</a></a></p>
