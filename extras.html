 <strong>My most popular Scratch project</strong>
 <p>My most popular Scratch project is called <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/784930853/">Chao Creator</a> If you <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/search/projects?q=chao%20creator">search on Scratch for it</a>, you're bound to find one not too far from the most popular, with mine having 11 views.</p>
 <strong>My love for Sonic</strong>
 <p>When I was in school, browsing on my iPad, I found a video of a certain blue hedgehog, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUwGMTOnHss">Sonic Colors intro</a> to be exact, and liked it. Since then, I've been liking Sonic a lot! However my love for this blue pineapple has become less, and more, casual, because again, I had other things to do than see a cool blue hedgehog run all day.</p>
 <strong>More about my apps</strong>
 <p>If you look <a href="https://tinyurl.com/sonicmisc">here</a>, you'll see that I made <b>LOADS </b>of apps. Ranging from Android, and all the way to Windows and Mac! These apps turn out to be useful for me in some cases. Mostly I just use them to kill time. After summer, I did my schoolwork and found it to be much more fun than the summer, and so my app-making urge has gone down. And I'm happy that I can expand to more topics! The app-making started all with the Sonic Channel app, and ended with a website FULL of other apps, some especially useful, some occasionally useful, and some just NOT useful (but about <b>99%</b> of them are useful in one way or another)</p>
