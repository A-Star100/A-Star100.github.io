  <h2><b>Old Layout</b></h2>
  <p>The old layout was with a heading at the top, a "topnav" (because it was below the header), and a footer. Didn't look that great, but it looked good for a start.</p>
  <h2><b>Newer Layout</b></h2>
  <p>The new layout is much, much better. Now, it has a sidenav, resembling Google Sites (just without the same font). Remember the small text!</p>
  <h2><b>Improvements</b></h2>
  <p>The site has bigger buttons, CSS animations, and even a maintenance page that notifies users when the site is under maintenance!</p>
  <h2><b>Newer-er Layout</b></h2>
  <p>This layout was based on a W3Schools W3.CSS template, modified to fit for a website.</p>
  <h2><b>Improvements</b></h2>
  <p>This new layout looked a <b><em>lot</em></b> less cluttered, and was almost the exact same as the current one but with very different CSS.</p>
  <h2><b>Newest Layout</b></h2>
  <p>The site now has a custom domain, better buttons and styling, and is more well-rounded overall.</p>
  <h2><b>Improvements</b></h2>
  <p>The current layout has a lot of stuff to offer and looks cleaner, along with a better organized side menu.</p>
