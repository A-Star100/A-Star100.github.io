  <h2>OLD LAYOUT</h2>
  <p>The old layout was with a heading at the top, a "topnav" (because it was below the header), and a footer. Didn't look that great, but it looked good for a start.</p>
  <h2>NEW LAYOUT</h2>
  <p>The new layout is much, much better. Now, it has a sidenav, resembling Google Sites (just without the same font). That's it. Remember the small text!</p>
