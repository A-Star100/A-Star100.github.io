<strong>This website</strong>
<p>Web development turned out to be pretty useful. Whenever I made websites in Google Sites, I could use this one as an independent, direct-download file server that didn't get watermarked with Google, DropBox, OneDrive, and all of that stuff. In fact, this also sorta <b>widens my reach</b> which is pretty cool to be honest. Then again, I've been so distracted that I really forgot to update this website. It turned out to be very useful, though, and put my HTML5 skills to the test.</p>
<strong>My apps</strong>
<p>I made a <b>bunch</b> of apps in the summer. One could make QR codes. The other was a web browser (that had questionable security). And another was a doodling app (that was feature-rich). When I was 7, I was a certified BYJU's app developer and now it really makes sense why :)</p>
<strong>My Scratch projects</strong>
<p>As you can see, I have a Scratch profile with some cool projects, all involving Sonic, my favorite little blue hedgehog. I have publicized some, but over 200 aren't. Some worthy of being published, some not. Enjoy exploring my Scratch creations :)</p>
<strong>My GitHub</strong>
<p>I wanted to preserve one of my app's source code on GitHub one day. At the time, I was a beginner at GitHub. I was just doing the basics. Little did I know it would all come to this :)</p> 
<strong>My 2021 code revival</strong> 
<p>One day, back in 2021, I followed tutorials to create some websites and hosted them using the now practically-dead <a href="https://000webhost.com">000webhost</a> website hosting service. The revival project revives the deployed project (now removed from 000webhost), and another un-deployed one. The revival can be found <a href="https://ani2021.netlify.app">here</a>.</p>
<strong>My movies</strong>
<p>I make tons of movies, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandub">fandubs</a>. View my fandubs <a href="https://bit.ly/jcdbme">here!</a></p>
<strong>My songs</strong>
<p>Along with movies, I also make music. Want to learn more? Well, then listen to them for yourself <a href="/songs.html">here!</a></p>
