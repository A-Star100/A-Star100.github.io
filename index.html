<strong>Sonic Channel</strong>
<p>Sonic Channel is my Sonic news site that has an Android app in the "Other Ways To Experience Our Website" page. It was life-changing, however I had to discontinue it one day or another (and after about 7 months, the time came). </p>
<strong>My apps</strong>
<p>After Sonic Channel, I decided to make many other useful apps. One could make QR codes. The other was a web browser (that had questionable security). And another was a doodling app (that was feature-rich). When I was 7, I was a certified BYJU's app developer and now it really makes sense why :)</p>
<strong>My Scratch projects</strong>
<p>As you can see, I have a Scratch profile with some cool projects, all involving Sonic, my favorite little blue hedgehog. I have publicized some, but over 200 aren't. Some worthy of being published, some not. Enjoy exploring my Scratch creations :)</p>
<strong>Sonic Channel on GitHub</strong>
<p>After I discontinued Sonic Channel, I wanted to make a bang and preserve the source code for years to come using GitHub. At the time, I was a beginner, or what most people call noob, at GitHub. I was just doing the basics. Little did I know it would all come to this :)</p>
<small>This site was one I coded, with some basic CSS from W3Schools. And GitHub Pages was used for deployment.</small>
