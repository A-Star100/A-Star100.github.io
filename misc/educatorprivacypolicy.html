    <p>
      By using the Educator app, you accept the following terms and conditions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          By using the AI model (ChatGPT, 4o-mini) and Google/Wikipedia search results, you adhere to their privacy policies and agree that any activity that could be questionable to your privacy
          should be referred to them and not the creator of the Educator app, as he will not be able to help you with privacy issues.
        </li>
         <div class="spacer">
        <li>
          Do not share personal information with the AI model or Google/Wikipedia if search results are enabled. The information you submit will be processed by them. We have no control
          over how information gets processed by these third-parties, and thus you may not contact us for any reason whatsoever about privacy concerns and data collection.
        </li>

        For all else, please refer to OpenAI, Google, Wikipedia, or MIT App Inventor for their policies and how they handle your data.
