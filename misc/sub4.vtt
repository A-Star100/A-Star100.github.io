00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.640
The robots produced by infallible Meteor
Tech that is popular all over the world

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.760
with an excellent security system are
apparently running amok in various

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.280
places. The international security
organization G.U.N is now investigating

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.879
the event. Apparently there have been no
official comments from...

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.160
[Sonic] Is this the meteor that fell last night?
[Tails] Yeah, it really surprised me when I was

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.799
sleeping.
I woke up and found this at the door.

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.840
(Knuckles yawns) We'll be at Megalo Station in no time
Knux!

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.840
TARGET DETECTED...
INITIATING DEFENSE MECHANISIMS NOW

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.759
[Knuckles] What?

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.640
[Tails] Whoa!
What do we do, Sonic?!

00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:36.699
[Sonic] Get to that elevator!

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.599
[Knuckles] Why the heck are they chasing us?...

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.159
[Tails] Could those be the robots the news was
talking about earlier?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.159
[Sonic] Look out! The door may open!

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.320
[Sonic] Brace yourself!

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.560
[Tails] Sonic!

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:29.560
[Sonic] Why am I not falling? Could this be the stone's power?!

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.560
All right! YAHOOOOO!

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.840
[Jet] Looks like there's nothing to worry about!

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.760
I got it!

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:45.239
[Wave] That's a shooting star! Interesting.

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.959
[Storm] Whatcha doing back there Wave?
[Wave] Ahem! I'm making a wish!

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.200
Isn't it said that if we make a wish
before the shooting star disappears it will come true?!

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:04.319
[Storm] Are you a kindergartner?!
It's such a kiddie thing! Right, boss?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.319
What!

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.480
[Jet] Oh star, grant me the power to defeat that blue little pest!

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.199
Augghhhh!

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.400
Oh no! The trap!

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.680
Looks like my wish has come true!

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.280
[Wave] Got it, Master Jet. I'll show you the info!

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.560
[Jet] So, show it to me!
[Wave] Just as I guessed, this stone, called the Ark Of Cosmos, is an

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:42.560
engine unit for the Babylon Garden developed by our ancestors long ago.
[Jet] So it's an engine part, huh?!

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.120
[Wave] No, it's not just a part!
I can't say anything unless I study a

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.800
bit more about this structure,
but this stone's magnetic field converts

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:52.080
the mass energy of the planet and in doing so it...

00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:00.320
[Jet] Aaah, cut to the chase! In short, what's this stone useful for.
[Wave] To put it simply, it converts

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.319
gravity into different energy and with
that power the Babylon Garden is capable

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.600
of warping to different areas. I'll research a little more.
[Jet] I see, so that

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.520
power was gravity that saved us.
[Wave] Oh, one more thing. According to the

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.840
ancient documents of Babylon, there are 5 Arks Of The Cosmos, and one of them

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.880
is the master unit. The other four are lead to
the master unit

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.080
and attract each other.
[Jet] I don't quite understand what this all

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.880
means, but if they're drawn to one
another we can make a detection radar

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:33.039
for them. Get to work right now!
[Wave] Understood...
[Storm] Boss!

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.960
[Jet] What's with all this noise!
[Storm] Boss, take a look at this!

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.120
[Newscaster] Repeat.
This morning, a Meteor Tech security robot

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.840
that was in charge of guarding the Megalo
City Museum, robbed the meteorite on

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:51.440
display and is currently on the run near
the Megalo Station City!
[Jet] That's the ark

00:06:48.639 --> 00:07:00.840
of cosmos! Storm! Set the course for
megalo station at full throttle!
[Storm] Yes boss!

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.840
[Jet] So, I guess it's a wild goose chase, huh?

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.440
Again? Too easy!

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160
Augh! Oh no!

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:42.440
[Wave] Master Jet!
[Storm] Boss!

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.840
[Amy] Fated lovers are always destined to be drawn together, silly!

00:07:52.240 --> 00:08:01.759
[Sonic] Amy!
[Amy] Actually, I ran away from those robots that

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.759
were chasing after me! I was so scared!

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:11.440
[Tails] Amy, I think those robots were after that stone you had!
[Sonic] In order to solve this we

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:16.319
have to investigate in Meteor Tech's headquarters!
[Wave] We've already gathered the

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:19.440
information. So let's outrun them and go
before they can spot us.

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:26.400
[Jet] So, it's up to us to decide who's the
fastest one in the world! You won't be

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:30.000
holding the title for long!
[Knuckles] Sonic, we've got company!

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.399
[Sonic] Oh, yeah, let's go!

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.399
Yahoo!

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.399
Gotta go fast!

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.200
We need to plan our movements.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.720
Wha?!

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
[Knuckles] Darn!

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:17.440
[Jet] Long time no see, Sonic The Hedgehog!
[Sonic] Jet?

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.920
[Wave] Long time no see, shorty.
[Tails] Wave!

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.760
[Storm] Time to settle the score from last time, jerk!

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:33.120
[Knuckles] Anytime loser, loser albatross.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:37.120
[Jet] Cut it out, Storm! Hey girly!
Give me back the Ark Of The

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:41.279
Cosmos right now!
[Amy] what are you talking about?!

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:45.120
[Jet] Don't play dumb with me!
You took the Ark Of The Cosmos that we

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.560
obtained right out of our hands, loser!
[Sonic] Wait... girls hate stubborn men, Jet!

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:53.440
[Jet] I don't care. Today is the day we finally

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:57.440
see which one of us is the fastest thing
alive! Held by yours truly!

00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:02.320
INTRUDERS DETECTED

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:10.480
[Tails] Sonic, it's too dangerous here, we have to leave right now!
[Sonic] The reunion party's gotta wait!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.160
Jet, you stay here!
[Jet] Hey, I'm coming with you!

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:22.640
[Storm] Uh-oh. I can't let you pass unless you hand me that stone!

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.360
[Amy] I'm gonna lose sight of Sonic, you loser!

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:31.079
[Storm] Wait up!

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:41.040
[Jet] You can use it, too?
[Sonic] It's pretty handy, am I right?!

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:44.839
ENGAGING E.M ALGORITHIMS, MAXIMUM VALUE
ACCESSING MOTHER COMPUTER, MOTHER

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.959
COMPUTER ACCESS DENIED
[Eggman] Whyyyy!

00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:53.680
Huh?
What's this racket? And now of all times?!

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.560
[Knuckles] Did something just fall there!

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.040
[Eggman] I'm not a ball!
[Sonic] Eggman!

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:11.200
What are you doing here!
[Eggman] What are you talking about, this is my

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:14.079
company! Muhahahaha!
[Sonic] Eggman!

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.360
So I guess you're the puppet master behind this scheme, huh?

00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:26.720
[Eggman] Puppet Master? What are you talking about?!
[Sonic] I'm talking about the

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:32.000
global robot rampage!
[Eggman] Well, I've been having questions about that myself, but

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:36.560
my answers are secret!
[Knuckles] Tell us you belly!

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:41.440
[Eggman] Stop calling me that! Okay, I'll tell you,
since we've been friends for such a long time!

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:46.480
Even I don't know why they were rampaging that night.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:50.560
But I do know that they have a leader.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.200
[Sonic] So Eggman really doesn't know anything, then.

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:58.320
[Tails] Maybe since the robots were attacking Amy because of that ring,
this ring

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:03.600
might have something to do with the
rampage!

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:03.600
[Eggman] Where did you get that!

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:14.000
So you were hiding something all along
Egghead!

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.000
[Knuckles] Tell us everything you know, Eggman!

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.040
[Eggman] Oh fine, I'll tell you.

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:28.880
All of my robot's actions are controlled by the mother computer.
As the backbone of the

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.639
Meteor Tech network, it was
supposed to be the perfect computer.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:40.480
However,
something went wrong with the external

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.480
remote control. It stopped working!

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:49.120
In reality the mother computer's power
unit uses the same stone that you have.

00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:52.959
According to my analysis it appears that
the stone has the ability to convert

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:58.160
enormous mass energy into different
energy and to create a unique magnetic

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.160
field.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:06.160
[Sonic] Huh?
[Eggman] Shut up and listen! I don't know why but it seems that the

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:11.839
leader robot has the stone with the same
power as that of the mother computer

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.839
inserted into it.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.399
If my deductions are correct, the leader
robot is going around all over the world

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:26.880
causing the other robots to go out of
control so that they'll collect these

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:30.959
mysterious stones.
[Sonic] Why do they need these stones?

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:36.880
[Eggman] Even I don't know why.
[Jet] They're drawn to one another.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:43.680
These aren't just ordinary rocks you'd
find at some playground. These rocks are

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:49.519
spoken of in the babylon clan as...
Hey, girly! Give me back the Ark Of The Cosmos!

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:52.480
[Tails] Where's Amy?
[Wave] Where's Storm?

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.240
[Storm] Hold on!
Wait for me!

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.800
[Amy] Geez, you're so stubborn, don't you
want to quit?

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.839
Fine, if you want this stupid stone so
bad.

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:31.839
Where in the world am I?

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:43.560
Thanks to you I got separated from Sonic
you idiot!

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:50.240
[Amy] Take responsibility and look for the
exit for me, got that?

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.040
[Storm] Yes.

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:10.760
[Amy] What's that sound?

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:46.959
[Storm] What?! This is it!

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.079
It's the same stone that I saw at Gigantech rocks!

00:15:50.399 --> 00:16:00.399
Now I got two!
I have to report to Master Jet

00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:04.360
immediately! Bye girl!
[Amy] Come back here! Oh for the love of...

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:20.480
[Jet] He's late... What is Storm doing?!!

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:24.800
[Storm] Excuse me, boss.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:33.880
[Jet] You're late!
[Storm] But I brought a bundle!

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:42.240
[Jet] A fine job coming from you Storm! Not
half bad!

00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:49.600
[Wave] Master Jet! [Jet] What is it?
[Wave] While I continued analyzing

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:53.600
ancient documents, I found this curious
description.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:57.600
I'll decipher it so that it fits your
small intelligence level.

00:16:56.399 --> 00:17:01.920
[Jet] Go ahead.
[Wave] At last we have reached our decision, we

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:05.520
will detach the engine units from the
ship,

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:10.079
for if we delay the whole engine may
eventually get consumed entirely by the

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.079
lightless black!

00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:15.600
This is crucial, and we need to worry about this.

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:23.199
[Jet] The lightless black you say? What's that about?!

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:27.919
[Wave] Who knows? What do you think?
[Jet] Heck if I know!

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:33.280
Anyway we'll leave thinking about all
that stuff for later, right now we've got

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:35.679
Arks Of The Cosmos to retrieve.
Huh?

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.520
What... the....

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.840
HEYY!

00:17:53.200 --> 00:18:00.200
Let's go full throttle near that dumbhead!

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.200
Full speed ahead!

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.360
[Sonic + Tails + Knuckles] Amy!

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:19.120
[Amy] Took you long enough!
[Tails] What could this be? [Amy] I don't know, but just when it

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:23.200
headed towards me at a really fast speed
it blew up all of a sudden. [Sonic] It blew up?!

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.720
[Tails] It charged towards you?
Could it be...

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.919
[Sonic] What's wrong Tails?
[Tails] Sorry, I haven't figured all this out yet.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:42.120
[Knuckles] So where's that meathead, Storm?
[Amy] He took something out of this robot and

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:42.120
ran off somewhere.

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:54.240
[Knuckles] Shouldn't the robots stop rampaging
everywhere by now?

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.600
[Tails] It's not that simple, Knux.
If the incident started due to Eggman

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.880
inserting the stone into the mother
computer as a power source then I don't

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:06.039
think the rampage would stop unless we
get the stone out!

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.039
[Knuckles] So where's that?

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:15.840
[Amy] Ah... I remember Storm saying something
curious.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.760
He said the thing he took out of the
robot was identical to the one he found

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:25.799
somewhere else... Um
where was it he said?

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:25.799
Gi-Gi-Gi-Giga, Gigante...

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.400
[Knuckles] Gigantech Rocks!
[Amy] Yeah, that giga thing!

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:38.640
[Sonic]You know it, Knuckles?
[Knuckles] It's a pretty famous ruin among us treasure hunters... or whatever...

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:42.559
There's a legend that

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:47.200
speaks of a wish-granting star being
sealed there somewhere...

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:50.320
[Tails] Legend of shooting stars...!
Sonic! Let's go to Gigantech rocks

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:56.559
right now!
We can find out more about those stones!

00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:00.000
[Knuckles] Leave the directions to me!
But it's said that the star shard is

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:04.559
sleeping deep inside the ruins, so
getting it won't be easy. No one's ever

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:10.679
made it out alive or even there...
We'll be putting our lives on the line...

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.679
[Sonic] It's nothing new, don't worry!

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.679
Was there an earthquake here or
something?

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.320
[Knuckles] Ah! It's gone

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:52.320
[Sonic] What's wrong, Knux?
[Knuckles] According to the legend, the star shard

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:56.280
is supposed to be on this chalice but...
did it roll off somewhere?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.760
[Sonic] Hey, Tails what's this painting?

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:18.640
[Tails] The divine wings...

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:23.120
A legendary bird that gods rode
to fly through heavens!

00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:25.679
Knuckles, let's see if you can read the
epitaph.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.760
[Knuckles] Okay...

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:38.799
The divine wings, straddler of stars, lost
their plumes to the lightless black and

00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:45.280
fell to the surface...
The plumes became as stars and returned to

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:47.840
this land, we the Babylon clan.
[Sonic] Babylon?

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.320
[Knuckles] How are those stones and those guys
connected?

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.120
[Tails] We don't know yet...
but don't you think the stones the

00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:02.320
robots are after could be the wing
plumes written here.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:07.280
The divine wings, straddler of stars, in
other words could they be units that

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:10.840
control a spaceship or aircraft?
[Sonic] So then those divine wings are...

00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:15.960
[Tails] That's right... the Babylon Garden.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.440
[Eggman] Muhahahaha!
[Jet on aircraft] Come back here!

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:48.240
[Tails] Knuckles what did the rest of this
epitaph say?
[Knuckles] Uh, hold on

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:52.720
We the babylon clan will seal one of the
stars here,

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.360
and another into the down running great
hollow

00:22:53.840 --> 00:23:00.880
until the day,
the divine wings are revived...

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:06.000
There's still more...

00:23:03.679 --> 00:23:13.120
The great hollow, lying in the east among
the Earth, strained red by the dawn's light...

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:17.679
[Tails] That's where Eggman and Jet are headed!
The great hollow must be the crater

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:22.720
formed when the meteorite struck!
I got it! That must be where Eggman found

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:26.080
the plume!
Do we happen to know where the mother

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.520
computer is? It's highly possible that
it's somewhere here.
[Sonic] Let's catch up with

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.520
them so we can know more.

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:39.760
[Wave] Took you long enough you guys...
[Storm] Eggman's in there, and we've gotta race to

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.640
the finish!
[Sonic] So what's that loser's goal this time?

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:48.640
[Tails] He's probably planning to use the
stone's power to command every robot on

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:51.840
the globe at once from this facility.
There could be more to this...

00:23:53.919 --> 00:23:57.840
[Jet] So, wanna race for revenge?

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:06.919
[Sonic] Sounds nice!
[Jet] Whoever wins will be the fastest creature on the Earth!

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.919
[Sonic] Wait for me!

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:36.880
[Wave] Hmm... this must be the master unit...
SYSTEM ERROR OCCURED, ALL COMMANDS HAVE

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:40.000
BEEN CANCELLED. ERROR, ERROR...

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.919
[Eggman] I've been planning to create Eggmanland
for so long and all of my plans have

00:24:41.679 --> 00:24:51.360
been destroyed!
[Sonic] Accept defeat, Eggman!
[Knuckles] Is this a trap

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.360
again, what did you do you loser!

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:06.080
[Wave] It must have resonated with all five
units together and came down here on its own.

00:25:02.559 --> 00:25:08.320
[Jet] So the legend was true, interesting...
[Sonic] Here ya go!

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:14.960
[Jet] OUR FIGHT ISN'T SETTLED YET, OUR FIGHT AIN'T DONE!

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.640
[Wave] We have our goal done, Master Jet, so let's hurry back to the Babylon Garden!

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.559
hmm

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:43.159
[Sonic] All right, we're gonna go home too

00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:52.880
[Tails] Soni,c why do you think the ancestors of
the babylon clan sealed the unit into the

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.880
Gigantech rocks?
[Sonic] Who knows?

00:25:53.279 --> 00:26:01.360
[Tails] Yeah, what was up with that?
(mentally) The lightless black that attacked the

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:06.240
divine wings...
the explosion of the robot that attacked

00:26:03.919 --> 00:26:06.240
Amy...

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.840
We can't let those meteorites get near the Babylon Garden!

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:36.640
[Sonic] Why is it still functioning Eggman? You
told us it wasn't!

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:43.120
[Eggman] I don't know
[Sonic] What'd you say

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:48.559
[Eggman] I do know that some kind of strong
electromagnetic wave is being generated

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:53.080
nearby, possibly by the stone and also
what forcibly executed this program...

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.720
[Tails] Sonic! The Babylon clan was not able to
control the power of those meteorites!

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:05.360
[Sonic] What does that mean?
[Tails] I figured out how those stones can

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:09.840
change gravitational polarity!
It's a black hole!

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:14.320
The lightless black that attacked the
divine wings is a black hole produced by

00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:17.320
the gravity, amplified by the meteorite's
power!

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.039
[Jet] What the!
[Sonic] What?

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.840
[all characters in unison] What's this?

00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:17.120
[Tails] At this rate the entire planet will be
sucked into the black hole and end!- AAAH!

00:28:19.001 --> 00:28:23.450
[Tails] Thanks Sonic!
[Eggman] The planet is doomed!

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:34.480
[Jet] Wave? how do we stop this thunderstorm?
[Wave] If we remove the engine room's core unit

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:39.520
that powers the Babylon garden's
mobility it's likely that this will stop!

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:42.840
[Sonic] We'll go on ahead
[Tails] Stay safe guys!

[Babylon Crew in unison] Yeah!

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:51.600
[Amy] In the end, I wonder what those
meteorites really were...

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:55.840
[Tails] Those meteorites were programmed to be
able to gather the units on their own,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.559
so after Eggman found the first meteorite
and inserted it into the mother computer,

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:11.520
the program was executed and caused
robots around the world to go out of

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:16.640
control... I may be wrong about that though...
[Sonic] Who made that program anyway?

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:21.039
[Tails] I have no idea...
it could be the Babylon ancestors,

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:25.200
or it could be something even more
mysterious...

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:29.360
Maybe it was a warning to humanity that
got involved with power beyond control.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:36.000
[Knuckles] But about the Babylonian...
[Amy] I can't believe they were the descendants of aliens...

00:30:33.679 --> 00:30:40.799
[Knuckles] HEY! You interrupted me!
[Amy] Long ago they crash-landed on this planet...
[Sonic] Wait for Amy, guys...

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:44.000
[Amy] So the engine units that they detached
at that moment

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:50.799
they were praying to the night skies for
the units to fall to the surface someday...

00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:55.200
Every time a shooting star would fall...
[Sonic] I bet they were wishing to go back to their home planet...

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:04.679
[Amy] That must be why it became a custom to
wish upon the shooting stars...

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.720
[You-know-who] Sonic!

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:51.000
Thanks for watching! Also, you-know who was Jet!
