// No Microsoft Clarity tracking exists. If you want the source code with tracking, look at the "with-ms-clarity-tracking" branch. Turns out a cookie consent banner is harder than I thought. I'll use Microsoft Clarity for more business-oriented stuff, why use it for my personal site? (at least, in the published branch) :)
