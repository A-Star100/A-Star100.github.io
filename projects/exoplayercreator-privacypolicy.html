        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the ExoPlayer Creator app. The app includes features such as a camcorder, QR code scanner, speech selection, and more.</p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>The app requests the following permissions to provide essential features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera Permission</strong> – The app requests access to your device's camera to enable the camcorder feature for recording videos and the QR code scanning feature.
                <small>This is not required if you use <b>ExoPlayer</b> or <b>Simple ExoPlayer</b> or don't attempt to scan QR codes in-app.</small>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Microphone Permission</strong> – The app requests access to your device's microphone to support the optional speech selection feature. This feature allows you to select a video player to create with voice commands (e.g., "ExoPlayer," "Simple ExoPlayer," "VideoView").
                <small>This is not required if you don't use the <b>Speech Select</b> feature (in tutorial).</small>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Photos and Videos Permission</strong> – The app requests access to your device's photos and videos to allow you to select and view media within the app. To make selecting media faster, the app requires a photos and videos permission to eliminate clutterred UX and UI.
                <small>This is not required if you use <b>ExoPlayer</b> or <b>Simple ExoPlayer</b>.</small>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Music and Audio Permission</strong> – The app requests access to your device's music and audio to allow you to select and view media within the app. To make selecting media faster, the app requires a music and audio permission to eliminate clutterred UX and UI.
                <small>This is not required if you use <b>ExoPlayer</b> or <b>Simple ExoPlayer</b>.</small>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Notifications (Optional)</strong> – The app requests access to notifications to simply notify you about things that happened.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These permissions are essential for most functionalities in the app other than <b>ExoPlayer</b> or <b>Simple ExoPlayer</b>.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>We do not collect or store any personal data. The permissions you grant are used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Recording videos</strong> via the camcorder feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Scanning QR codes</strong> for additional app functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Enabling speech selection</strong> to allow voice commands for selecting a video player to create.</li>
            <li><strong>Conveniently play videos</strong> to allow choosing a video file only once and instantly playing it the next.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications (Optional)</strong> to simply be aware of any small events that took place.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other App Capabilities</h2>
        <p>In addition to the permissions listed above, the app also includes the following capabilities that may not require specific user permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Network Access & Viewing Network Connections</strong> – The app requires network access to be able to play any sort of media through URLs. The app can view network connections to notify you if you are on mobile data or a VPN with suggestions to improve your experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Bluetooth Pairing</strong> – The app can pair with Bluetooth devices to enable video/audio playback through external Bluetooth speakers or other compatible devices. No personal information is shared with Bluetooth devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreground Services</strong> – The app has a feature (optional) that enables background play creating foreground services to play audio in the background in VideoView.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Vibration</strong> – The app lets you create sleep timers, so the vibrator is used to notify you when one rang, or when time has run out for the timer.</li>
            <li><strong>Change Audio Settings</strong> – The app can play audio using VideoView, and the specific method of playing used means the app has the capability to turn up or down volume. However this permission is not used or exploited in any way that is questionable. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is our priority. All data collected by the app remains local to your device and is never transmitted or stored on external servers. We do not collect any sensitive data, and we take reasonable steps to ensure your information is securely handled.</p>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>You can choose whether to grant or deny access to the camera, microphone, and photos/videos permissions. If you deny any of these permissions, certain features, such as video recording, QR code scanning, or speech selection, may not function properly, but you can still use other features of the app.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, and we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of the policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.</p>
