    <h2>Domain-Driven Design</h2>
    <p>
      In this article, we are going to take a look at Domain-Driven Design. Since it's a very complicated concept, we're going to review this in a simpler way.
      For a more detailed overview, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">take a look at this book</a>.

    Domain-Driven Design helps keep your code clear and organized.

    Many programmers make their code messy and unorganized.
      <div class="tutorial-box">
      <h4>Step 1. Take a fresh look</h4>
      <p>Let's say you have data that serves as a bag. Instead of stuffing everything in that one bag, take a fresh look and picture your code as reality.
        Let's also say that there are candies in that bag. We want to define its attributes, in this case, its wrapper color and taste.

        We want to keep everything organized and clear. We want to name our candies and their attributes properly.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 2. Clean up</h4>
      <p>Let's say you work at a company, and a new employee arrives and lands into your team.
        If you have messy code, how do you expect this new employee to understand the shenanigans going on in your team.
        It's not like you'll have the time to explain all of this nonsense to somebody as knowledgeable about this company as a freshman in a college.

        This is why you should start describing your code properly, as described in step 1. Take your time, however long, to clean your code up, and make sure to 
        follow the principles of Domain-Driven Design with new code you create.

        Especially for complex programs, this can save you and even the company time and money, and make your end product meaningful both to developers and end users.
      </p>

      <h4>Step 3. Think like a computer</h4>
      <p>As reviewed in the <a href="/tutorials/articles/think-like-a-computer">previous article</a>, thinking like a computer combined with Domain-Driven Design
        can expand your reach and bring your efficiency levels up.
