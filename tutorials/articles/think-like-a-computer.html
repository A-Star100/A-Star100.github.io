    <h2>Think like a computer</h2>
    <p>
      In this article, we are going to talk about how to think like a computer to make your products better.
    </p>

  <div class="center">
    Thinking like a computer is crucial to programming. It removes the need for aggressively testing your products while helping you picture what
    a computer will make of your end product.

    Without this thought process, your product can end up having a myriad of bugs.
      <div class="tutorial-box">
      <h4>Step 1. Take a step back</h4>
      <p>In times of trouble, the best decision is to take one step back and look at your programming. Be the computer. Be the end user.
        Picture the future.
        
        A lot of the times, programmers simply create inefficient code without thinking of the issues end users may have to deal with, let alone
        issues with your end product that can affect how computers use it.

        We've all seen this, some of us even experienced it.
      </p>
      </div>

    <div class="tutorial-box">
      <h4>Step 2. Grade your code</h4>
      <p>Think of your code as a book. If a book has incorrect grammar, how can you expect the reader to just understand what's going on?
        This is why your second step should be to look at your code and note down its inefficiencies along with how you can improve it.

        Once you've got that down, you can write your new concept in psuedocode, focusing just on the code without worrying about issues that come from the external
        frameworks and libraries you use.

        After that, this is the best time to start bringing your psuedocode to life.
      </p>
      </div>

    <div class="tutorial-box">
      <h4>Step 3. Test</h4>
      <p>To really get a feel of how your product will be out in the wild, another good decision is to test it. Thinking like a computer can't always resolve issues that might come up
        from external frameworks, libraries, and even the programming language itself.
      </p>
      </div>

    <div class="tutorial-box">
      <h4>Step 4. Domain-Driven Design</h4>
      <p>To prevent something like this from happening again, you can use Domain-Driven Design.
